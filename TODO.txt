Actually, we plan to use SMART package manager. It uses several "rules", to find backends, channels and interfaces.
Maybe it will be easier to keep SMART complient with its original architecture and to have two libraries:
	- SMART: Our package manager that will contain source code of our backends (macports and wpkg), channels and interfaces.
	- WPKG: Tool used to install/remove/update applications onto Windows
