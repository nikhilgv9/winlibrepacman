WinLibre Package Manager Proposal
==================================

**Contact**: *bertrand.cachet@gmail.com*

Scope
*****

Main Goal
=========

We want to develop a Windows package management system in order to ease the 
deployment of Open Source applications on Win32 systems.

Description
===========

The functionality is divided into several parts:

+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                     | To be able to install a software, it should be packaged.          |
|                     | Package will be a simple compressed file (ZIP, TAR, XAR)          |
|                     | which contains description of the software, specific              |
|  **Packages**       | scripts (that will be used to install/remove/update/enumerate     |
|                     | the application onto the OS) and a binary representation          |
|                     | of the application itself (list of binary files that need         |
|                     | to be installed or an official/unofficial setup of the            |
|                     | application).                                                     |
+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                     | Place (WebServer, DVD) where we find informations about the       |
| **Repository**      | software available in the distribution. There is two levels of    |
|                     | informations:                                                     |
|                     |                                                                   |
|                     | * Generic: A list of the name, version and description of         |
|                     |   the applications which will inform the user about which         |
|                     |   application is available.                                       |
|                     | * Specific: At a specific place, it is possible to find           |
|                     |   specific information on a given application: URL of the         |
|                     |   package, dependencies, required ... which will be used to       |
|                     |   install/remove/update the application itself.                   |
+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                     | Application used to search/install/remove/update applications on  |
| **Package Manager** | the user's Windows system. It will handle software dependencies   |
|                     | will install libraries/applications needed by the software        |
|                     | to run properly. User will interact with application using CLI or |
|                     | GUI.                                                              |
+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Package Creator** | Used by developers to create package to deploy their application  |
|                     | on Windows system.                                                |

Package Manager
---------------

Package Manager is divided in two parts:

* One will install/remove/update application using the package file.


+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| **wpkg** *action* <package>     | Install/remove/update software described into package |
|                                 | file. wpkg will use scripts located into the package  |
|                                 | and will use/download binary representation of the    |
|                                 | application                                           |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| **wpkg** *status* <package>     | Get stattus of the package.                           |
|                                 | Possible output:Installed/Not Installed/Update        |
|                                 | Available.                                            |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| **wpkg** *show* <package>       | Show information about package. It will output: name, |
|                                 | description, license and so on.                       |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

* Another one will search/download packages from repository. It will also handle 
  dependencies.

+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| **wpckgmgr** *update*           | Updates package lists. Get last package list from     |
|                                 | repo                                                  |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| **wpckmgr** *action* <name>     | Install/update/remove package. Handles dependencies.  |
|                                 |                                                       |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| **wpckgmgr** *search* <keyword> | Search through name/description of packages. Outputs  |
|                                 | names of packages whose name or description fits the  |
|                                 | keyword                                               |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| **wpckgmgr** *show* <name>      | Outputs information about package. It outputs even if |
|                                 | package wasn't installed or downloaded. Manager gets  |
|                                 | information from package list.                        |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

Technical requirement
*********************

The Repository Server
=====================

It's a RESTful web application where each URL represent a package:

* GET access is public and can return JSON, YAML or HTML formats. GET access 
  will be used by WinPacMan client to get information about the package.
* POST, UPDATE and DELETE access are protected (authentification via OpenID or 
  Google Account). These access are used by the Package Generator Tool 
  to update information about the package.
